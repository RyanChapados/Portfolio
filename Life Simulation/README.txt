Description:
This program is designed as a simple simulation of life. Within the simulation there are doodlebugs(preadators)
and ants(prey). The simulation begins with 100 ants spawning in random locations and 10 doodlebugs spawning in 
random locations. 

Rounds:
Each ant will then move in a random direction every "round", and breed every 5 rounds, and the
doodlebugs will move in a random direction UNLESS they are next to an ant. If they are next to an ant, they
will eat the ant by moving on top of it. The doodlebug dies if it hasn't eaten an ant within 5 rounds, and breeds
every 10 rounds. 

End:
The program ends when there are no ants or doodlebugs left, or 100 rounds have passed

Modes:
Automatic mode creates a new round every second
Manual mode lets the user hit enter the continue to the next round
